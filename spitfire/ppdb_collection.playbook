# PPDB Collection Playbook for Spitfire (8000 Series)
# This playbook collects PPDB (Platform Database) files from all line cards
# 
# The script will automatically:
# 1. Run 'show platform' to discover all line cards and active RP
# 2. For each LC: attach, run pd_aib_show_prod, rename file, SCP to active RP
# 3. Compress all files on active RP into timestamped tarball
# 4. Transfer tarball to jumpserver and upload to cxd.cisco.com
#
# Usage:
#   msft_collector --playbook-scan ppdb_collection.playbook <hostname> <sr_number> <cxd_token>
#
# Expected execution time: ~2-5 minutes per LC + compression time
